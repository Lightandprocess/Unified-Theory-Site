A speculative exploration into the origin of the universe, light, and consciousness

Theory Overview Diagram Mathematical Concept Dark Matter Insight Core Theory 

This theory proposes that light is not only the foundational element of the universe but also the conduit for consciousness. Light is timeless — at its speed, time stands still. When the universe evolved beings capable of consciousness, it completed a feedback loop: light from the Big Bang reached observers who could perceive and reflect on it.

In death, the “light at the end of the tunnel” may be a mechanism for relaying consciousness data back to the universe’s singularity. Each observer experiences time uniquely, and humans serve as the universe’s means to document and experience time. Black holes recycle light and matter, and white holes may represent rebirths — or even the Big Bangs of new universes.

The diagram below models the feedback loop of light, consciousness, black holes, white holes, and universe generation.

Mathematical Concept 

The simplified form of the speculative unified equation could resemble:

U = ∫ [L(c) × C(t)] dt + E(Δs) → B 

Where:

U = Total observed universe L(c) = Light as a function of c (speed of light, timeless) C(t) = Consciousness as a function of time E(Δs) = Energy distributed across expanding spacetime B = Birth of new universes or white hole events Dark Matter Hypothesis 

This theory proposes that dark matter could be “dead light” — light that failed to be recycled through the black hole/white hole system. It retains gravitational influence but contains no observable information. Its interaction with mass and planetary cores may even influence gravity locally, helping explain anomalies across different planetary environments.
