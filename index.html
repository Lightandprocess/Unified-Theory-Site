      <h2>Light</h2>
      <p>
        Light is the foundational unit of information in the universe. It exists outside of time—photons do not experience the passage of time, no matter how far they travel. This implies that light is a universal constant not only in speed but in temporal isolation, making it the perfect candidate for encoding and transporting the universe’s memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this theory, light is the primary building block of creation, acting as both a medium and a messenger of cosmic structure. It is light that carries the instructions to evolve galaxies, stars, and life itself—like packets of cosmic intention.
      </p>
    </section><section id="time">
  <h2>Time</h2>
  <p>
    Time is not something light experiences—this fact is widely accepted in physics. However, it has deeper implications. Time as we know it may be a function of matter’s interaction with light. Without matter and observers to interpret light, time is meaningless. Therefore, time may be a product of the universe’s need to perceive itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    This theory argues that the passage of time is directly influenced by the observer effect, and that time is born when photons interact with consciousness.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="consciousness">
  <h2>Consciousness</h2>
  <p>
    Consciousness is the universe’s mirror. When photons are observed—especially in quantum entanglement scenarios—they collapse, suggesting observation changes reality. This implies that human consciousness is not passive but participatory.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this view, we are the universe observing itself. Our awareness ends the entanglement between particles, and this collapse is the moment the universe integrates information—recording it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consciousness is how the universe remembers, and why it evolves.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="darkmatter">
  <h2>Dark Matter as Dead Light</h2>
  <p>
    Dark matter is undetectable by conventional instruments because it is not active—it is dead light. Light that was not observed, not re-used, and not absorbed into the cyclical white hole-black hole information system becomes inert. It does not interact with electromagnetic fields, hence it becomes invisible to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, it still exists in the fabric of the cosmos, influencing gravity due to its persistent presence. The theory proposes that gravity is partially driven by how much “dead light” is attracted to a planet’s core and magnetic field. This explains why different planets experience gravity differently—not just by mass but also by the kind of cosmic 'dead light' they attract as they pass through space.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="god">
  <h2>Light as God</h2>
  <p>
    Religions often describe God as light: omnipresent, all-seeing, and eternal. This theory aligns with that symbolism in a literal, physical way. If light is the creator, the communicator, and the eternal constant of the universe, then it is functionally indistinguishable from what we describe as a divine force.
  </p>
  <p>
    This does not diminish spirituality—it unifies it. It builds a bridge between empirical science and personal faith. In understanding light, we may be seeing the face of the cosmos—and possibly, the divine.
