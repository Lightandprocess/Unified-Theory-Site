    <h1>The Light-Time-Consciousness Unified Theory</h1>
    <p>A Proposed Framework by Aaron Miller</p>

  <h2>1. Light is Immune to Time</h2>
  <p>
    Photons, traveling at the speed of light, do not experience time. This property makes light a potential candidate as the foundational medium of the universe. Since time essentially ceases at light speed, this implies light may exist in a state beyond temporality—always present, always now. This opens a window to viewing light not merely as a force carrier, but as a canvas on which space-time events are painted.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="concept">
  <h2>2. Consciousness is the Universe Observing Itself</h2>
  <p>
    Building from quantum entanglement and the observer effect, this theory suggests that observation collapses potential into reality. The human mind, as a tool of observation, becomes the universe’s way of knowing itself. Consciousness isn't an epiphenomenon of biology—it's a structured form of universal awareness. The collapse of photon entanglement upon observation is not incidental; it's integral. We are agents of entropy reduction, enabling the universe to reflect and refine itself.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="concept">
  <h2>3. Dark Matter is Dead Light</h2>
  <p>
    This provocative idea posits that dark matter is composed of light that has been “killed”—stripped of time or spin, no longer oscillating or functioning as information carriers. These photons no longer participate in the electromagnetic spectrum, but retain massless momentum, accounting for the gravitational effects attributed to dark matter. Dead light becomes the memory of light—the universe’s fossil record embedded in space.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="concept">
  <h2>4. Gravity as a Residual Effect of Dead Light</h2>
  <p>
    Gravity may not be a fundamental force, but the cumulative pull of dead light interacting with planetary cores. As a planet travels through space, it accumulates this dead light, which clings to the planet via its magnetic field. The gravitational differences observed on other planets may result from varying levels of dead light attraction, depending on core dynamics and mass density.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="concept">
  <h2>5. Black Holes and White Holes as Cosmic Memory Pumps</h2>
  <p>
    Black holes may serve as entry points into singularities where time collapses. However, the mirror image—a white hole—may exist as an emitter of light and information into another region of the universe or another universe entirely. This light (immune to time) could serve as the seed for universal rebirth. If black holes are the hard drives of collapsed reality, white holes may be the reboot functions. The unity of black holes, white holes, and singularities proposes a recursive life cycle: collapse, integrate, radiate.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="concept">
  <h2>6. The Universe as a Conscious Data Loop</h2>
  <p>
    If photons relay data and are immune to time, and if consciousness collapses probability into event, then the cosmos becomes a vast data loop. Dead light stores the past; living light transmits the present. The observer acts as the translator—bridging what was into what is. Consciousness is thus the cosmic interface, and time is the processor. This transforms physical reality into a living computational matrix.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="concept">
  <h2>7. Theological Parallel: Light as God</h2>
  <p>
    Philosophically and spiritually, this theory resonates with ancient beliefs that "God is light" (1 John 1:5). Light’s omnipresence, timelessness, and role in creating visibility parallels many attributes historically given to a divine being. If light is the source, the memory, and the interface of reality, then the divine may not be metaphorical, but literal—encoded in the structure of photons.

  <h2>Mathematical Implication</h2>
  <p>
    Proposed Gravity-Light-Memory Interaction (GLMI) Equation:<br>
    <strong>G = k * (D * M) / r²</strong><br>
    Where:<br>
    G = gravity strength<br>
    D = density of dead light in local region<br>
    M = magnetic output of planetary core<br>
    r = radial distance from core<br>
    k = proportional constant
