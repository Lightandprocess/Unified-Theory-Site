  <h2>Key Concept: Light Is Immune to Time</h2>
  <p>Photons—particles of light—travel at the speed of light and therefore do not experience the passage of time. This suggests that light exists outside the temporal dimension as we understand it. In this theory, light becomes not just a phenomenon but a foundational constant of reality: it never ages, always exists, and may be the ultimate medium of information transmission in the universe.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Key Concept: Consciousness as the Universe Observing Itself</h2>
  <p>This theory posits that human consciousness is not separate from the universe but rather a function of it—an emergent feature of a self-aware cosmos. Through quantum entanglement and the observer effect, observation plays a role in the unfolding of events. Consciousness may serve as a mechanism by which the universe takes stock of itself across time and space.</p>

  <h2>Key Concept: Dark Matter as "Dead Light"</h2>
  <p>Dark matter has mass but does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. This theory suggests it may be composed of "dead light"—light that has expended its energy and can no longer interact, yet still retains gravitational influence. As planets move through space, they attract this dead light based on mass and magnetic properties of their core, producing gravitational force. This offers a novel way to conceptualize gravity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Concept: The Black Hole–White Hole Singularity Loop</h2>
  <p>The theory proposes that black holes may not simply be endpoints, but portals that recycle matter and information through a white hole—perhaps even contributing to the birth of new universes. This feedback loop ties into the idea of the singularity not as a one-time origin point but an ongoing node in a cyclical universe, linking entropy and rebirth.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mathematical Expression</h2>
  <p>The foundational relationship might be expressed symbolically (early approximation):</p>
  <div class="equation">
    G = (L_d × M_p × C_a) / (ΔT)
  </div>
  <p>
    Where:<br />
    <strong>G</strong> = Gravity experienced<br />
    <strong>L_d</strong> = Density of dead light (dark matter)<br />
    <strong>M_p</strong> = Mass of planetary body<br />
    <strong>C_a</strong> = Core activity/magnetic output<br />
    <strong>ΔT</strong> = Differential time density of surrounding space<br />
  </p>
  <p>This equation proposes that gravity is not just a curvature of spacetime but a dynamic force produced by the interaction of planetary magnetism and dead light accumulation.</p>

  <h2>Philosophical Parallel: Light as God</h2>
  <p>Religious and spiritual traditions often refer to divinity as "light"—infinite, eternal, always watching. This theory may provide a scientific echo to that metaphor: if light is eternal, omnipresent, and the mechanism by which the universe becomes aware of itself, then the parallels between the scientific and the spiritual may not be coincidental, but convergent.</p>
