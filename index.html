    <h1>The Unified Theory of Light and Creation</h1>
    <p class="lead">A unique framework exploring the relationship between light, black holes, dark matter, and the birth of universes</p>
  </header>  <section>
    <h2>1. Core Concept</h2>
    <p>This theory proposes that <strong>light</strong> is the fundamental unifying force in the universe. All matter, energy, and even the experience of time arise from light in its various forms. At the quantum level, everything breaks down to energy—and all energy is, in some form, light.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>2. Black Holes, White Holes, and Creation</h2>
    <p>Black holes absorb light, matter, and information—compressing it into an unimaginable density. White holes (hypothetical opposites) may represent the output end of that compression, spewing newly formed energy and matter into a fresh universe. The interaction between these two states forms a cycle of destruction and rebirth: a universal recycling mechanism.</p>
    <p>The trigger for universe formation may be <strong>light collapsing under extreme conditions into a solid-state or singularity</strong>, causing a high-energy explosion—a Big Bang. This theory provides a possible explanation for the unusual brightness of early galaxies seen by the James Webb Telescope.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>3. Time and Consciousness</h2>
    <p>The universe doesn’t observe or measure time—humans do. We are the timekeepers. Without conscious observers, time may have no functional meaning. The way we <em>perceive</em> time (faster when joyful, slower when bored) demonstrates that consciousness plays a role in shaping our experience of time’s flow.</p>
    <p>Perhaps our role in the universe is to <strong>witness, document, and experience</strong> time for the cosmos—a form of universal feedback that allows the universe to understand itself.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>4. Dark Matter as "Dead Light"</h2>
    <p>Dark matter may be the remains of light that no longer carries energy or information—<strong>"dead light"</strong>. It exerts gravitational influence but can’t be seen or detected using normal instruments. If black holes recycle light, perhaps some fragments remain unused, suspended in the universe as silent scaffolding.</p>
    <p>This explains why dark matter has mass-like effects but no electromagnetic signature—it’s the leftover husk of light.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>5. Gravity and Planetary Cores</h2>
    <p>Gravity could be understood as the attraction of this dead light to planetary bodies. As planets move through space, their magnetic fields and mass attract this non-luminous matter. This might explain why gravity varies on different planets—not just due to mass, but also the interaction with dark matter in specific regions of space.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>6. Interactive Timeline (Coming Soon)</h2>
    <p>A future interactive timeline will show stages of the universe according to this theory, with explorable stages like "Pre-Light Compression," "Singularity Flashpoint," "Expansion Phase," and more.</p>
  </section>  <section>
    <h2>7. About the Author</h2>
    <p>This site was built to showcase a personal theory by a passionate thinker and amateur cosmologist—someone who has pondered deeply about the nature of existence, time, and light. With minimal formal education in physics, this theory was developed independently, showing that big ideas can come from anywhere.</p>
