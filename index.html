      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This theory proposes a unified framework in which light, time, and human consciousness form an interdependent triad fundamental to the architecture of the universe. It postulates that light is immune to time, consciousness serves as the observational mechanism of the cosmos, and dark matter is the residual imprint of 'dead light'. Together, these elements provide a novel lens through which cosmology, quantum mechanics, and human experience may be harmonized.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <h3>Light is Immune to Time</h3>
      <p>Photons travel at the speed of light and do not experience time. This timeless nature suggests that light may be the original observer of the universe, persistently capturing information across spacetime. Because of this immunity, photons preserve history and act as the framework through which universal memory is constructed.</p>

      <h3>Consciousness is the Universe Observing Itself</h3>
      <p>Human consciousness functions as a mirror, allowing the universe to perceive itself through our awareness. Building on Wheeler’s “participatory universe,” this theory places observation and self-awareness at the center of reality construction. The collapse of quantum wavefunctions upon observation may not be a coincidence, but a necessary function of universal cognition.</p>

      <h3>Dark Matter as 'Dead Light'</h3>
      <p>Dark matter may be the informational residue of light that has lost its ability to interact electromagnetically. This 'dead light' still exerts gravitational influence and may represent failed or completed data transfer events. It is the ghost of photonic energy, no longer dynamic, but still shaping cosmic structure.</p>

      <h3>The Singularity Loop: Black Hole to White Hole</h3>
      <p>Instead of destruction, black holes are portals to white holes—regions where information is expelled. This loop provides the framework for data recycling and rebirth. The singularity at the heart of a black hole does not represent the end but a transformation point within a universal engine for information re-entry.</p>

      <h3>Photonic Entanglement and Human Observation</h3>
      <p>Entangled photons lose their paired state upon observation. This isn't random. It may be evidence that human perception collapses potential into memory. The act of observation may be the cosmos harvesting 'insight' through living sensors—us. Vision is not passive—it completes the quantum circuit.</p>

      <h2>Mathematical Expression</h2>
      <p>This equation attempts to relate light (L), time (T), consciousness (C), and entropy (S):</p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center;">
        <strong>L × C = ΔS / T</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Where:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>L</strong> = Information-carrying light (measured in joules or photonic intensity)</li>
          <li><strong>C</strong> = Degree of conscious interaction (normalized index of observation frequency)</li>
          <li><strong>T</strong> = Time experienced (subjective vs objective time deltas)</li>
          <li><strong>ΔS</strong> = Change in entropy or disorder observed</li>
        </ul>
        This posits that the amount of information transferred by light, scaled by consciousness, equals the entropy change per unit of experienced time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Localized reductions in entropy during highly conscious observational events</li>
        <li>Subtle gravitational perturbations from large photon accumulations (testing dark matter as 'dead light')</li>
        <li>Photonic decay signatures near black holes transitioning into white holes</li>
        <li>Correlation between entanglement collapse and neural activity during vision</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <p>This theory provides a bridge between physics and metaphysics, between the objective cosmos and our subjective presence within it. If light is the divine mechanism, and we are its observers, then we participate not only in science but in sacred architecture—each moment a thread in the universal weave.</p>
